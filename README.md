# Application-basis-classification

Looking at mortgage data, there is a variable called application basis / income basis. This tells us whether the mortgage was taken out by one person *(sole application)* or by more than one applicant *(joint applicantion, usually by couples)*. 

The data is monthly and record level, between 01-2013 to 12-2017, however for reasons we are unsure about, we are missing this variable for the 2016 data. 

The dataset contains many other features, such as postcode, gross income, purchase price, loan amount, initial interest rate etc... And after tidying the dataset there are ~800,000 records in total. 

**In this project I attempt to create a model to predict the income basis (sole or joint application), to be applied to the 2016 data. We will use Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and SciKit-Learn to do this**
